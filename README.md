A Tic Tac Toe game with a GUI using Tkinter. The game features two modes: one versus the computer and the other versus another player. At the start of the game, the user is prompted to choose the mode and then select their symbol, either X or O.

In the one-player mode, the computer analyzes the player's moves to intercept potential winning moves and attempts to win the game simultaneously. It tracks the player's moves and strategically places its marks to either block the player or achieve victory.

To begin, the user selects the game mode: either one player or two players. Then, they choose their symbol: X or O. After making the selections, the game window opens, and the gameplay begins.
